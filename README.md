# GPT Lite, An Alternative ChatGPT UI

[__‚û°Ô∏è Go directly to the app__](https://cheapgpt.davids.garden/)

The GPT4 API is much cheaper than the ChatGPT subscription. This project provides a minimal UI to mimic the basic features of the ChatGPT subscription.

This can save you 240 USD per year, or give you 0.75-2.5 days of additional free time per year.[^1]

- ‚úÖ The core feature is **storing and organizing conversations**, so that results can be retrieved easily, and old conversations can be continued.
- ‚úÖ Live **streaming** of replies is supported.
- ‚ùå Other features of the ChatGPT subscription, namely **web search and plugins**, are interesting but ultimately rather useless gimmicks, and I do not implement them.
- üîú As an additional feature, this UI will allow **editing the system prompt** in a convenient manner, and storing and editing multiple bot personas.

[^1]: Assuming a pay range of 12-40 EUR/h, 8h workdays, 1USD = 1EUR, no taxes on income, and negligible costs for the GPT4 API usage.
