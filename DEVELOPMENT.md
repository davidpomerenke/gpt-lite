## Usage

Main usage is via the [hosted version on website](https://cheapgpt.davids.garden/).

For local use:

1. Create a `.env` file and define your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## Development

Backend and frontend should be run in separate processes, so that both can be hot-reloaded:

- `npm run dev-backend`
- `npm run dev-frontend`

## Config

Some keys need to be set up correctly in `.env`.
